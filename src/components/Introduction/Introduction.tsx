    <p>
      We backpack around the country meeting incredible people who are making things better in their communities.
      Sometimes with big projects, sometimes with small everyday magic.
      We tell their stories because they’re worth telling, and because seeing what others are doing can spark ideas in the rest of us.
      Most people already know what their community needs; we just help shine a light on the clever, creative ways they’re solving real problems.
      In the end, everything we do comes back to education and inspiration, because once you learn something useful,
      you can’t unsee it; and maybe, just maybe, it gets you to make a little change of your own.
