      Our grand vision is to create a database of people doing amazing things in their communities
      and then link them up with each other so that they can inspire and support each other.
      Along the way, we’re connecting people who care; people with ideas, tools, time, or just a willingness to listen and help.
      We weren’t meant to figure things out alone, and honestly, it’s way more fun together.
