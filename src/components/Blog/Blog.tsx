    <p>
      It was a cool but sunny day on the second of September in 2024.
      It was a good day for hiking, which came highly appreciated since we've committed to about 2500km of hiking.
      We've spent four months planning and arranging and making sure we knew what we were doing.
      We did not, in fact, have any idea what we were doing, and honestly,
      no amount of planning, reading or researching could even remotely have prepared us for much of what we experienced.
